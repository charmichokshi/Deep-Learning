Traditional Round Robin scheduling algorithm reduces the penalty which short jobs suffer in FCFS algorithm and long jobs suffer in SJF 
algorithm. Infect there is no starvation in RR for jobs but has some scope of improvement on criteria such as waiting time, turnaround time,
throughput and number of context switches. Proposed Dynamic Quantum Time algorithm is an amalgamation of traditional RR and Priority 
Scheduling which gives approximately 40% better performance as compared to simple RR algorithm.
